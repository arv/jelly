One must\n  be attached by default, or directly on the element with “onclick”.\n- Click events are not fired if the content of the page changes in a mousemove\n  or mouseover event.\n- Click events are fired 300ms after the touch sequence ends.\n- More information: [Apple Developer Documentation](http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/reference/safariwebcontent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html).\n\nAdditionally, Touch events are sent only to the element that received the\ntouchstart. This is fundamentally different than mouse events, which fire on the\nelement that is under the mouse. To make them behave similarly, touch events\nneed to be retargeted with `document.elementFromPoint`.\n\nThese incompatibilities lead to applications having to listen to 2 sets of events, mouse on\ndesktop and touch for mobile.\n\n**This forked interaction experience is cumbersome and hard to maintain.**\n\nInstead, there should exist a set of events that are normalized such that they\nbehave exactly the same, no matter the source: touch, mouse, stylus, skull\nimplant, etc. To do this right, this normalized event system needs to be\navailable for all the web platform to use.\n\n*Thus, PointerEvents!*\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nBy default, no PointerEvents are sent from an element. This maximizes possibility that a browser can deliver smooth scrolling and jank-free gestures. If you want to receive events, you must set the `touch-action` property of that element.\n\n1. Set up some elements to create events with the `touch-action` attribute\n  - `<div id=\"not-a-scroller\" touch-action=\"none\"></div>`\n      - Generates events all the time, will not scroll\n  - `<div id=\"horizontal-scroller\" touch-action=\"pan-x\">`\n      - Generates events in the y axis, scrolls in the x axis\n  - `<div id=\"vertical-scroller\" touch-action=\"pan-y\">`\n      - Generates events in the x axis, scrolls in the y axis\n  - `<div id=\"all-axis-scroller\" touch-action=\"pan-x pan-y\">`\n      - Generates events only when tapping, scrolls otherwise\n      - Can also have the value `pan-y pan-x` or `scroll`\n\n1. Listen for the desired events\n  - `pointermove`: a pointer moves, similar to touchmove or mousemove.\n  - `pointerdown`: a pointer is activated, or a device button held.\n  - `pointerup`: a pointer is deactivated, or a device button released.\n  - `pointerover`: a pointer has moved onto an element.\n  - `pointerout`: a pointer is no longer on an element it once was.\n  - `pointerenter`: a pointer enters the bounding box of an element.\n  - `pointerleave`: a pointer leaves the bounding box of an element.\n  - `pointercancel`: a pointer will no longer generate events.\n\n1. As elements come and go, or have their `touch-action` attribute changed, they will send the proper set of PointerEvents.\n\n### Examples\n\n- [Simple Event Example](http://polymer.github.io/PointerEvents/samples/simple/index.html)\n- [Pointer Painting](http://polymer.github.io/PointerEvents/samples/paint/index.html)\n- [Multi Pointer Trac](http://polymer.github.io/PointerEvents/samples/tracker/index.html)\n- [Empty Space Game!](http://polymer.github.io/PointerEvents/samples/spaceship/index.html)\n\n## Polyfill Details\n\n### Getting Started\n\n1. Clone this repo or install from bower (pointerevents-polyfill)\n1. Place the loader script in the document head\n  - This Repo\n    - `<script src=\"PointerEvents/src/pointerevents.js\"></script>`\n  - Bower\n    - `<script src=\"bower_components/pointerevents-polyfill/pointerevents.min.js\"></script>`\n1. Set up your event listeners\n1. You're Done!\n\n### Where can I use PointerEvents?\n\nPointerEvents should work on all \"Evergreen\" (self-updating) browsers.\n\nIt has been tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, and IE 10.\n\n## Polyfill Limitations\n\n### touch-action\n\nAccording to the spec, the\n[touch-action](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerevents/raw-file/tip/pointerEvents.html#the-touch-action-css-property)\ncss property controls whether an element will perform a \"default action\" such as scrolling, or receive a continuous stream of PointerEvents.\n\nDue to the difficult nature of polyfilling new CSS properties, this library will\nuse a touch-action *attribute* instead. In addition, run time changes involving\nthe `touch-action` attribute will be monitored for maximum flexibility.\n\nTouches will not generate events unless inside of an area that has a valid `touch-action` attribute defined.\nThis is to maintain compositiong scrolling optimizations where possible.\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\n#### Full Support\n\nChrome 18+, Safari 6+, IE 10, Firefox 14+\n\n#### Partial Support\n\nOpera 12-14, does not support changes to `touch-action` attribute, nor added or removed elements\n",
